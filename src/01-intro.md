# Introduction

Functional programming is an ever increasing popular paradigm for structuring complex code.

## Let's suppose we have a quick game we're building

Every line of code either saves data to memory (e.g. a user's score) or uses that data (e.g. increase that user's score)

But with 1000s   of lines of code - every libe if code can potentially use (and **depend**) on that data ðŸ¥´

High risk - every time I want to change any line, I have to consider whether it could affect other lunes (and when I miss something, I get bugs)

What's the answer?

## The answer has been _functions_

**Compartmentalise**-Reduce the potential impact of any give nline to maybe 10 other lines (inside the function)

**But** even within a 10 luine function, 'resoning' through what each line does is hard - & the code may still have affects outside the function (via global variables)

_functions as we know them, may not be enough!_.

## Imagine if we could structure our code into individual pieces where _almost every single line_ is self-contained

* The only thing any given line depends on are inputs (explicitly stated in that very line)
* The only consequences of the line would be its output (explicitly stated in that very line)
* _And_ each line could get a nice human-readable label for when we use it!

This could transform how we write code, debug it and read about others' code.

But how could we do it!? ðŸ˜²

## Functional programming

**Tiny functions:** Save every single line (or few lines) as its own function.

**No consequences except on that line** Each function's only 'consequence' is to have its result given to specifically the lext line of code ('function call') and not to any other lines.

**Recombine/compose** Build up our application by using these small blocks of self-contained code combinging them up line-by-line by _referring to their human-readable name_.
